# Awesome Artificial General Intelligence 

[Artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as "strong AI", "full AI" or as the ability of a machine to perform "general intelligent action".
